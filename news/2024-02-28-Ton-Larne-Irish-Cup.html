                            <p>Newington supporters will have very fond memories of the ‘Noughties’. Halcyon days for all associated with the club.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of Eamonn McCarthy and an influx of new players, the 'Ton’s fortunes were about to turn dramatically.</p>

<p>The club had managed to gain promotion from the Amateur League’s Division 1A – scoring one goal more than close rivals Rosario – to reach the Premier Section.</p>

<p>In the mid-Noughties, the team was backboned by Sean Hughes, Sean Adams, Danny Hale, Liam Bradley, Gary McGearty, Cormac Brannigan, Thomas Duffy and Neil Quinn.</p>

<p>McCarthy's side took to the Premier Section like a duck to water and in the same season as facing Larne in the 2006 Irish Cup quarter-finals, the club claimed their first Border Cup success with a narrow 1-0 win over Wellington Rec at Wilgar Park over the Christmas period.</p>

<p>Some of the football the team played that season was sublime and with a Border Cup success stitched to their backs the Newington players attacked the early rounds of the Irish Cup with gusto.</p>

<p>Mid-Ulster sides Blackers Mill and Killymoon Rangers were swept aside before the road got steeper with hard-fought wins coming over Strabane, Killyleagh and Coagh United (after a replay).</p>

<p>Thomas Duffy, now part of the backroom team alongside Paul Hamilton and Conor Crossan, scored in every round up until the testing sixth round trip to Portstewart when the ‘Ton unveiled high-profile signing, former Celtic and Cliftonville midfielder Gerard ‘Skin’ Lyttle, who was persuaded to join the north Belfast intermediate side.</p>

<p>Liam ‘Bogey’ Bradley scored the only goal of the game against Portstewart to set up an enticing Irish Cup quarter-final clash with Larne.</p>

<p>Managed by Kenny Shiels, the Inver Park men were full of top-quality and experienced campaigners. Kris Lindsay and the late Frankie Wilson, while Gary McCutcheon and Mark Dickson provided the cutting edge in attack.</p>

<p>BBCNI had jumped on the Newington bandwagon that year to produce a fly-on-the-wall programme about the club’s dramatic Irish Cup run.</p>

<p>For the Larne game, manager Eamonn McCarthy was mic’d up to capture the pitchside adrenaline and energy of the day in March 2006.</p>

<p>Liam Bradley fired the ‘Ton into an early lead and with another cup upset possible.</p>

<p>The home side were awarded a soft penalty after Wilson was felled in the area and Dickson slotted past Paul Snodden in goal to equalise for the Irish Premier League side.</p>

<p>McCarthy protested the controversial decision and was subsequently sent off by match official Adrian McCourt, with assistant Paul Briers assuming control for the remainder.</p>

<p>The Newington manager had taken issue with the way in which the referee spoke to him on the sideline, which was recorded by McCarthy’s BBC microphone, and it was somewhat an embarrassing episode for McCourt when the exchange was aired on TV.</p>

<p>Newington had more chances to edge in front again, but couldn’t convert them. And with three minutes of stoppage-time to be played, Larne finally broke Newington’s brave resistance – as it turned out after six minutes of stoppage-time – through Aaron Black.</p>

<p>It was a devastating blow to the Irish Cup minnows who had charmed their way to the last eight by playing some brilliant football. Larne would fall at the semi-final hurdle – to Glentoran – and Belfast’s ‘Big Two’ battled it out in the final that year, with Linfield Peter Thompson grabbing a double to finish off their cross-city rivals.</p>

<p>Things would only get better for Newington that season as they won their first-ever Amateur League Premier Section crown – and another four titles would follow under McCarthy.</p>

<p>By a strange twist of fate, Newington and Larne do battle in the Irish Cup quarter-finals this Saturday – 18 years after their fraught meeting.</p>

<p>Both clubs continue to defy the odds today: Larne have emerged as a force in Irish football again with local businessman Kenny Bruce transforming their fortunes and Tiernan Lynch guiding the team on the field and winning their first Premiership title last season.</p>

<p>With a miniscule budget, Newington have somehow climbed the ranks and are punching their weight in the Championship – just one rung below senior football.</p>

<p>The fact that they play their ‘home’ games at Inver Park merely adds to the sense of occasion this Saturday afternoon – a host club that has treated the north Belfast men impeccably during their time there.</p>

<p>And, as for those halcyon days, they're still living them at Newington with two Steel & Sons Cups and a PIL title along the way.</p>

<p>The mighty 'Ton continue to live the dream - and the players and management are representing themselves, their families and their community with pride and distinction.</p>

<p>It's the only way they know.</p>
